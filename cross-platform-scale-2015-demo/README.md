# Cross Platform Demo

This sample shows how to build applications in both iOS and Android
with Buck with shared native code.

## Installing

Make sure you've [installed Buck](https://buckbuild.com/setup/install.html),
and if you want to use the Android code, make sure you've [setup your
environment properly](https://buckbuild.com/setup/getting_started.html)

## Building

You can build the demo applications from the command line!

### Android

For Android, build the demo with:

    buck install --run demo_app_android

### iOS

    buck install --run demo_app_ios

## Project Generation

You can create projects for IntelliJ (Android) and Xcode (iOS) so you
can use your IDE to make changes to your project still.  This is
unnecessary if you happen to be using [Nuclide](http://nuclide.io/).

### Android

    buck project demo_app_android

If you are on Windows, you'll want to run:

    buck project demo_app_android --experimental-ij-generation

### iOS

    buck project demo_app_ios
